## Contribute

Presently Prime is all concpet and very little in the way of implementation.
The broad plan is to implement in Javascript/Coffeescript so that Prime can
be used to write client-side web applications, as well as server-side 
web applications using Node.js, and then to also implement a faster general
purpose version in a modern systems language such as D, Go or Rust.

If anyone finds Prime of particular interest and have exceptional experience
in any of the above, there is an opportunity to be a founding developer.
