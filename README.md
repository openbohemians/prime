# Prime

Logical Programming in Plain Language


## About

Prime is a *logical programming language* in the heiritage of Prolog.

Here is the classic Socrates syllogism translated to Prime.

```prime
    x' is mortal: x' is human.
    Socrates is human.
    Socrates is mortal?
    -> true.
```

## Contribute

<b>The Prime project is seeking a *logical programming enthusiest* with
strong knowledge of logical langauge implementations to help take Prime to
the next level.</b>

Presently Prime is all concept and very little in the way of implementation.
The broad plan is to implement in Javascript/Coffeescript so that Prime can
be used to write client-side web applications, as well as server-side 
web applications using Node.js, and then to implement a faster general
purpose version in a modern systems language such like D, Go or Rust.

If anyone finds Prime of particular interest and have exceptional experience
in any of the above, there is an opportunity to be a founding developer.
